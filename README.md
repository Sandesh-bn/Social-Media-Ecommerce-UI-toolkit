# 🛠️ React Social Media + E-Commerce UI Components

Welcome to my little React playground! 🎉  
This repo is basically a **toolbox of UI elements** you’ll see all over social media apps and e-commerce sites. Instead of re-inventing the wheel every time, I made a bunch of reusable components.

----------

## ✨ What’s Inside?

Here’s the lineup (so far):

-   🖼️ **Image Gallery** – Zoom in, click through, show off those fancy product pics.
    
-   🎠 **Carousel** – Because everyone loves sliding things left & right.
    
-   ⭐ **Star Rating** – Click to rate, hover to glow… y’know, the classics.
    
-   💬 **Review Page** – Drop those product rants and love letters.
    
-   🧾 **Table** – Clean, sortable, scrollable data display (for the nerdy stuff).
    
-   💡 **Tooltip** – Hover & discover… it’s like a secret handshake.

## Future improvements
- Implement accesiblity 
- Implement responsiveness. All components works well on desktop. But it needs to be tested on other devices & screen orientation.
- Protect against xss, and sanitize inputs
- Make a PR if you want to collaborate.
